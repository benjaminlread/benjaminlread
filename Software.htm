<h1>Notes on software that I use</h1>
<HR align="center" size=1 width="75%">
<BR>
<P class="bottomlinepad">Below are some thoughts on software applications that I have found useful. I have no relationship with the vendors other than that of customer and user. I've skipped a few omnipresent programs that I use but have nothing in particular to say about, such as iTunes. Comments and suggestions welcome.</P>

<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Operating system</B>: Windows 7 (on my home PC); OS X (laptop and office computer); Android (on my phone).</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Bibliographic database</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall">I switched to <A target="_top" href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</A> from EndNote in February 2016. I use Zotero Standalone as well as the Firefox add-on. As Zotero matured, its advantages (excellent data acquisition, superior keyword management, free and open source, excellent web server sync and sharing, better data import/export, etc.) overwhelmed the small number of features where EndNote could still be said to have an edge.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Encryption</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall">I once used PGP when it was free. Currently looking for other solutions.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>File synchronization</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall">For a long time I tried to keep all my files based on just a single system, aside from backups. But it makes much more sense to keep mirrored copies of critical folder trees on each computer in use, as well as on a server drive. Careful synchronization then becomes a must. I use <A target="_top" href="http://www.syncovery.com/">Syncovery</A>.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Password management</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall"><A target="_top" href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</A> is free, open-source, thoughtfully done &mdash; in short, lovable.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Photo utility</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall"><A target="_top" href="http://www.irfanview.com/">Irfanview</A> has long been an impressive freeware utility for photo viewing and basic editing and format conversion. Note in particular the batch processing functions, e.g. for resampling or renaming a large number of photos or image files at once.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Text editor</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall"><A target="_top" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</A> won me over. I like the clean GUI, customizability, and the excellent selection of third-party plug-ins. I also use <A target="_top" href="http://www.editpadpro.com/">EditPad Pro</A>.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Statistics</B>: <A target="_top" href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</A> 14</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Web browser</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall"><A target="_top" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</A>, with these add-ons: <A target="_top" href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</A>, for self-defense against malicious code; <A target="_top" href="http://flashblock.mozdev.org/">Flashblock</A>, for getting control over the visual cacophony that many sites throw at you, and <A target="_top" href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</A>, for effortlessly synchronizing bookmarks among different computers.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall">Also, <A target="_top" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</A>, for interfacing with the world of Google: Contacts, Calendar, Documents, etc.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Word processor</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall">I was a WordPerfect dead-ender, cherishing the memories of versions 4.2 and 5.1, which got me through college. The realities of academic publishing and collaboration, along with the need to work with Chinese-language material, made me reluctantly switch to Word. As I learned more about it, and particularly since installing Word 2007 and <A target="_top" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx">Word 2010</A>, I came to embrace its paragraph-based, object-oriented ways. For those not already familiar with Word's finer points and the efficient but widely neglected styles feature, definitely see <A target="_top" href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/">Shauna Kelly</A>'s site, and also the <A target="_top" href="http://word.mvps.org/">MVP</A> site.</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad"><B>Miscellaneous utilities</B>:</P>
<P class="bottomlinepad indentsmall"><A target="_top" href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php">Speedfan</A> for monitoring system temperatures</P>
