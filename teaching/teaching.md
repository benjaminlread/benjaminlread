## Links and information for students

[Course sites](http://canvas.ucsc.edu/), pointers on [how to read](how-to-read.html) in college, guidelines for [presentations](presentations.html), guidelines for [reading responses](reading-responses.html), [research sources](research-sources.html) on comparative and international politics, information about [citing sources and avoiding plagiarism](citing-sources.html), citation [format requirements](http://politics.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/citation.html), [checklist](checklist-for-written-work.html) for all written work

What should you call me? I suggest currently enrolled undergraduate students call me "Professor Read." All others, including graduate students and everyone who is not a student, should feel free to call me "Ben."

## Future teaching

I will be on sabbatical in the 2023-2024 academic year, working on a book. I will resume teaching in Fall 2024.
