## Welcome 歡迎

I'm an associate professor of [Politics](https://politics.ucsc.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](about/ucsc-on-one-page.html); more about me [here](about/about.html), including office hours, contact information, and CV.

The site's [research](research/research.html) section gives a full overview of my work on local politics in China and Taiwan, and on field research methods, including details on my books and full text of articles and chapters.

Under [commentary](commentary/commentary.html) you'll find essays, interviews, and book reviews.

The [teaching](teaching/teaching.html) page includes my course schedule, syllabi, and resources for students.

[Tools](tools/tools.html) houses a few endeavors related to the Chinese language, code / software, and aviation.
