<h1>Research Sources on Comparative and International Politics (focused on Asia)</h1>

<h2>Purpose of this page</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">All Politics students should develop strong skills in acquiring high-quality information from the great range of sources that are out there. This is a crucial ability for you to have and that you can use in your academic work, your internships, future jobs, etc. With undergraduate students particularly in mind, I have compiled the following list of valuable sources of material on comparative and international politics, with a special focus on Asia.</P>
<h2>Books</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottomlinepad">To search for books, use the following resources:</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>UCSC's library</u>: simply start at the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">library site</a> and search CruzCat or Melvyl.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The <u>Library of Congress</u> (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/index.html" target="_blank">link</a>)</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Google Books</u>: You want to search, specifically, <a href="http://books.google.com">books.google.com</a>.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Harvard University's</u> <a href="http://lib.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">library system</a> (anyone on the web can search it): Search Hollis or Hollis Classic.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Amazon.com</u>: As you may know about <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/">Amazon</a>, in addition to new books it also sells cheaper digital editions (either for Kindle readers or for free Kindle apps on Mac/PC) and is a broker for used books.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>AbeBooks</u>: Particularly good <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/" target="_blank">site</a> for getting used copies of books.</P>

<h2>Think Tanks and Policy Journals</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>China Leadership Monitor</u>: This free, online <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/china-leadership-monitor">publication</a> features in-depth and well-documented reports by experts, including work on China's international relations and China-Taiwan relations in particular.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The <u>Congressional Research Service</u> is not a think-tank but the reports it produces are generally excellent, so be sure to search it on just about any topic you are researching. See below under "United States Government."</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>International Crisis Group</u> is an <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/" target="_blank">outfit</a> that produces detailed, careful, and well-documented reports&#8212;not on every topic in international affairs, but on things that relate to conflict in some way. You can search by county/region. Their "reports" are the in-depth write-ups; their "briefings" (etc.) are shorter and less substantive.<br>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>The Washington Quarterly</u>: An international affairs <a href="http://csis.org/twq/">journal</a> from CSIS (see below) with articles that have a certain depth to them and also include footnotes.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS)</u>: This think-tank publishes the Washington Quarterly (see above) but also has many other materials on its <a href="http://csis.org/" target="_blank">web site</a>. It also produces <a href="http://csis.org/program/pacnet-newsletter" target="_blank">PacNet Newsletter</a>; it contains short pieces, but they may be stimulating.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</u>: Respected <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/" target="_blank">think-tank</a> with a searchable web site; has various reports and publications.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Foreign Policy</u>: This well established <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/" target="_blank">publication</a> has both a magazine and a lot of web-only content, blogs, etc.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Foreign Affairs</u>: Published by the venerable Council on Foreign Relations, this <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/" target="_blank">magazine</a> pretty much defines "The Establishment." Despite its august reputation, the articles can be a bit shallow and are not documented, but sometimes they provide an important introduction or perspective. Note that the FA web site has its own content; the magazine is distinct and to get full-text access you will probably have to go through your home institution's library web site.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Current History</u>: Contains articles that are roughly six pages long giving an overview of the state of play on some issue, topic, or problem. At their best they can be wonderfully illuminating.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>National Bureau of Asian Research</u>: Valuable <a href="http://www.nbr.org/" target="_blank">source</a> for mainstream policy-related research.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>RAND Corporation</u>: Non-profit <a href="http://www.rand.org/">organization</a> and think tank that conducts research for many clients including the U.S. government.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>The World Bank</u>: "The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org" target="_blank">Bank</a>" amasses large quantities of reports and data in various formats. I always find the site difficult to search in a comprehensive way, but dive in, you might just come upon something that directly speaks to your topic. The World Bank's <a href="http://wdronline.worldbank.org" target="_blank">World Development Reports</a> provide a huge amount of information.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Yale Global</u>: This relatively new <a href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/" target="_blank">site</a> publishes fairly short but often useful pieces on various topics.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>The Wilson Quarterly</u>: A <a href="http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/" target="_blank">publication </a>of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, this journal is not limited to international affairs but has some valuable items.</P>

<h2>Academic Journals</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Note: You can usually search these publications via their web sites, but to get full-text access you will likely have to go through a <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">library website</a> (i.e., via CruzCat).</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Journal of Democracy: This highly readable journal reaches for audiences well beyond academic ones with articles on politics in countries around the world </P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">China Quarterly</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">China Journal</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">World Politics</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Studies in Comparative International Development</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">International Security</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">International Organization</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Inside Indonesia</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">World Development</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Latin American Politics and Society</P>

<h2>Journalism</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottomlinepad">In using journalism sources for writing papers, the trick usually is to find in-depth, "long-form" reporting that really explains an issue and provides insight. It takes real work to sift through the enormous amount of material out there to find such quality sources. Less commonly, shorter, garden-variety articles about a news event that just took place can be of use, but a grab bag of such "day stories" does not make for a good paper.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">Asia Times Online</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The Diplomat</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The Atlantic</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The New York Times (and its Sunday magazine)</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The Washington Post</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The Wall Street Journal</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The Economist</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The New Yorker</P>

<h2>United States Government</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">The <u>Congressional Research Service</u> produces high-quality and authoritative reports that include footnotes to sources. The official CRS web site contains no information for the outside world, but the State Department has a helpful <a href="http://fpc.state.gov/c18185.htm">index</a> and <a href="https://opencrs.com/" target="_blank">Open CRS</a> and the <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/index.html" target="_blank">Federation of American Scientists</a> have repositories.</P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Government Printing Office</u>: The congressional hearing search function can be found under their Federal Digital System feature. Hearings are organized by year. Provides access to congressional hearings from the 99th congress (1985-1986) and onward. <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG" target="_blank">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG</a></P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Library of Congress / Thomas</u>: The congressional hearing search function can be found under the section "Congressional Record." It allows users to search by keyword, members of congress involved, and date <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&amp;n=Record" target="_blank">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/LegislativeData.php?&amp;n=Record</a></P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>US Department of State</u>: Can search by year or can select "Search Congressional Testimonies" on left-hand menu <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/h/tst/" target="_blank">http://www.state.gov/s/h/tst/</a></P>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad"><u>Congress</u>: Can search by bill. Results include a summary, the actual text of the bill or resolution, titles, cosponsors, amendments, committees, and related bills. <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/" target="_blank">http://beta.congress.gov/</a></p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<P class="indentmedium bottompad">You should not use or draw on <u>Wikipedia</u> material in papers you submit to class (though if you do, be sure to cite it), but it never hurts to see what source materials are referenced in a Wikipedia entry. It might link to high-quality articles, books, etc.</P>
